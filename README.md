 ## introduction
 hey! This is a college project, and I am working with one more friend. So, you may save half the credits for him too. This is a social media platform built using the MERN stack. It's a web application therefore most of the part uses JavaScript. The platform provides you with most of the basic features like following, befriending, creating communities and of course, posting. But it has one more feature that will be the key attraction to our software(as Nakshatra says), the 'vote for everything' or just VFE.
 ## before you contribute
 I will get to the point straight forward. Behave civil and be a good human. whenever you contribute, update the contributions.md file(because that is how we keep track of everything perfectly and get to know you). You will get the format once you open the file.
